# Translation Comparison App

This is a React-based web application that allows users to perform standard translations between languages and compare translations from different AI models. The app integrates with Firebase for data storage and utilizes an external API for translation services.

## Features

- **Standard Translation:** Translate text between different languages using selected AI models.
- **Translation Comparison:** Compare translations generated by different AI models and evaluate them.
- **Model Selection:** Choose from various AI models such as GPT-4, Gemini, and DeepL for translation.
- **Firebase Integration:** Store translation data, user inputs, and comparison results in Firebase Firestore.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Copy translated text to the clipboard with a notification.


### Key Files

- **`App.jsx`**: The main component that handles routing between the translation and comparison features.
- **`CompareTranslate.jsx`**: Component for comparing translations from different AI models, allowing users to evaluate and rank them. Stores the comparison data in Firebase.
- **`Translator.jsx`**: Component for performing standard translations between languages. Handles form submission, translation requests, and storing results in Firebase.
- **`firebase.js`**: Configuration file for Firebase services, including Firestore, Authentication, and Storage.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nidhijay/AI-Translation-App
    cd translation-comparison-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**

    - Create a Firebase project and obtain your Firebase configuration.
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

    ```env
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
    ```

4. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Standard Translation:**
  - Enter the text you want to translate, select the source and destination languages, and choose the AI model for translation.
  - Submit the form to receive the translated text and copy it to the clipboard if needed.
